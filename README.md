# 🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction

This project predicts whether a breast tumor is **benign** (non-cancerous) or **malignant** (cancerous) using machine learning.

## 📁 About the Project

- Uses the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin** dataset.
- Applies three machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Compares their accuracy and predictions.

## 📊 What the Project Does

1. Loads and cleans the data.
2. Visualizes patterns and correlations.
3. Converts labels to numbers (benign = 0, malignant = 1).
4. Trains models and checks how well they perform.
5. Compares predictions with actual results.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
