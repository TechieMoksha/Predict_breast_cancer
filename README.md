🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction
This project predicts whether a breast tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) using machine learning.

📁 About the Project
Uses the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

Applies three machine learning models:

1. Logistic Regression

2. Decision Tree

3. Random Forest

Compares their accuracy and predictions.

📊 What the Project Does
1. Loads and cleans the data.

2. Visualizes patterns and correlations.

3. Converts labels to numbers (benign = 0, malignant = 1).

4. Trains models and checks how well they perform.

Compares predictions with actual results.

🛠 Tools Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
Scikit-learn

🚀 How to Use
Download the dataset (data.csv) from Kaggle.

Run the Python file in Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or any Python IDE.
